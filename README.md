# Tower of Ouroboros

An action roguelike where you climb an endless tower, slay enemies, and grow stronger with every floor.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Move**: `A` and `D` keys (left/right)
- **Jump**: `Space`
- **Switch Weapons**: `1` (Sword), `2` (Wand), `3` (Shuriken)

You start with three weapons and can freely switch between them during combat. As you level up, you can increase one stat of your choice from the following:

- STR (Strength) - Boosts sword damage
- INT (Intelligence) - Boosts wand damage
- DEX (Dexterity) - Boosts shuriken damage
- VIT (Vitality)
- AGI (Agility)
- LUK (Luck)

After clearing each stage, you’ll be able to upgrade your weapons or improve your stats. Occasionally, you may acquire rare special abilities that drastically change your playstyle.

The core challenge is to reach higher and higher floors — how far can you ascend?
